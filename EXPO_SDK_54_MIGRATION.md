## Breaking Changes to Address

### 1. React 19 to React 18 Downgrade
The main breaking change is the downgrade from React 19 to React 18. This may affect:
- Concurrent features
- New React hooks
- Server components (if used)

### 2. React Native 0.79 to 0.76
- Some newer React Native features may not be available
- Check for any 0.79+ specific APIs being used

### 3. Safe Area Context Changes
- API changes in `react-native-safe-area-context` from v5 to v4
- May require updates to safe area usage

## Migration Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 2. Clear Cache
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

### 3. Update EAS CLI (if using EAS)
```bash
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli@latest
```

### 4. Test the Application
- Test on iOS simulator/device
- Test on Android emulator/device
- Test web version
- Verify all features work correctly

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### 1. TypeScript Errors
If you encounter TypeScript errors related to React types:
- Ensure all React imports use the correct types
- Update any custom type definitions

### 2. Safe Area Context Issues
If you have issues with safe area context:
```typescript
// Old (v5)
import { useSafeAreaInsets } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

// New (v4) - should work the same way
import { useSafeAreaInsets } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';
```

### 3. React Native Screens Issues
If you encounter issues with React Native Screens:
- The API should remain the same
- Check for any deprecated methods
